  <note resp="#BP">I. Introduction. - II. Incest and the Greeks. - III. The origin of full sibling marriage in Egypt. - IV. The profile of census, epikrisis and other evidence from the Roman period. - V. Inheritance, demography, and family dynamics. - VI. Concluding discussion. The Egyptians under Roman rule started to believe that to practise brother-sister marriage was not only likely to make them wealthier but also fulfilled their destiny as Egyptians (assimilating fraternal and marital love, just as Isis had shown for her brother Osiris). - Pp. 131-139: Appendix: Probable and possible cases of brother-sister marriage (Fourth-century B.C. and Ptolemaic Period, Nos i-x; - Roman Period, Nos 1-95?).</note>
