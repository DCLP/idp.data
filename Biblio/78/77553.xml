  <note resp="#BP">The two main differences between what Herodotus has to say on Egypt and Ethiopia are that the Ethiopian material is much more organically embedded in the historical narrative and that there is a strand of fantasy and utopianism which appears in discussions of the Ethiopians, because of the mythical status they had already attained in Greek tradition.</note>
