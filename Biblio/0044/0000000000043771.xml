          <note type="annotation">In 1996 an area containing élite burials dating from the AD 1st century was discovered within a Late Scythian necropolis. Tomb 620 occupied a prominent place among the rich burials. Among the numerous and diverse finds one of particular interest was an object which was described in the first publication to appear as &amp;quot;a wooden pyxis cylindrical in shape and with a silver plaque attached&amp;quot; [height 8.6 - 9 cm?]. Subsequent examinations of this find have made it possible to draw the conclusion that it is a scrinium (capsa, cista, k€sth, te@xow) - a special case in which to store papyrus texts. The fine whittled sticks found together with the case are none other than Ùmfalo€ or umbilici - small sticks, attached to the ends of scrolls.</note>
