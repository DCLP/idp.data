Rhapsodes and lunatics. - V. An Airy Hypothesis. - V [sic]. Divulging the Mysteries. - VI. Last mysteries: Socrates, Plato and religious persecution in Athens. - "The treatise preserved in P. Derveni must have been written in the 430s or 420s B.C. It is either by an unknown pupil of Diogenes of Apollonia; or it is by Diogenes himself; or, most probably, it is the book of Diagoras of Melos."</note>
