  <note resp="#BP">The local temple shrine was being fashioned into a tax-collecting organization. Its traditional function in the social and economic order of the community was distorted by Rome, as Rome sought to exploit the wealth of Egypt for its own benefit. The priests became the wealthy servants of the Roman government. The people of the city responded to this by turning their personal religious life towards the home. Legends from the past sustained nationalism and preserved personal beliefs.</note>
