cu500_t | 1 | (Col. I) Baker, dyer, fuller, spear-maker, oilman, painter, cobbler, breastplate-maker, doctor, locksmith, mason, millstone-maker, shipwright, scraper-maker, armourer, tablet-maker, …, engraver, glassworker, … goldsmith, ... (Col. II) My (garment?) is lost; violent was he (who took it?), well-born was he who took it. It was bought for ten staters; if it had been a cloak I should not have minded. I seek but do not find it. It was taken without cause. He will meet with anger. Just so he took it, my lovely garment. A lion he was who took it, a fool who lost it. It was taken at night. He was a stranger who took it, it was nothing to one like him. I will choke myself, for I am cold. He is indicated to me, for he watches me (?) … It is winter, there is great cold. How utterly unfortunate was I!
