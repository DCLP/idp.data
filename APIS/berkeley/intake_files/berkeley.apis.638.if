Heron, son of Souchas, about thirty-two years old, with a scar on his left hand, acknowledges to Pakebkis son of Marepsemis, about twenty-eight years old, with a scar along his right shin, that he has received from him, Pakebkis, from hand to hand, one hundred thirty-two silver drachmas plus interest, which Pakebkis owed Heron according to the terms of a contract of loan drawn up by the record office of the village Theogonis in the present year on the fourteenth day of the month Phamenoth; and he has turned over this contract to Pakebkis for cancellation and invalidation. Nor shall Heron take action against Pakebkis with respect to what he has received, as stated above... (Here the papyrus breaks off.)
