cu500_t | 1 | The 36th year, Hathur 11. To Demetrios, one of the diadochoi, hipparches over men and epistates, from Paalas son of Harmais, ship's guard of the barge of Apollonios, one of the first friends and strategos and overseer of the revenues. On the (30th?) of Phaophi of the 36th year, the said barge being at anchor, certain persons approaching in their own boat came to anchor outside it (?) and broke away some of our gear, and when I rebuked them so that they might keep clear, they leapt on board with unseemly shouts and gave me many blows, with the result that in the tussle I lost a cloak worth 3000 drachmas of bronze as well as the broken gear, which was worth likewise 3000 drachmas of bronze. I beg you therefore to give orders … Farewell.
