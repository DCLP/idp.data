cu500_t | 1 | Apollon to Petesouchos, greeting. You must know that Kephalas and Petesouchos and their partners have applied to Demetrios concerning the works which they swear have been imposed upon their land, and that he gave them an extension of time (?). He has become much ashamed, and has ordered me to take soldiers and ravage them. Therefore, as I am occupied with urgent business, I have written to you so that you may undertake the matter; exact the money and keep of the copper one talent until I come down and receive it. If you neglect this I shall be obliged to come myself tomorrow. Good-bye. The 9th year, Choiak [.]. (Addressed on the verso) To Petesouchos.
