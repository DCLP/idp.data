cu500_t | 1 | To Kronios, archiphylakites of Kerkeosiris, from Harmiysis, komarches, and the Crown tenants at the same village. Marres the Topogrammateus is in the habit of coming to the village with numerous others armed with swords, and with the utmost insolence making continual attempts at extortion upon the wives of some of us and of others, disregarding the pledges which we have obtained from Lysanias, the (king's) cousin and strategos; wherefore many of us, having had our suspicions aroused, have retired to the neighboring villages. For these reasons we are hindered in the collection of the sums owed for both rent and crowns; and we therefore present to you this petition in order that you may give instructions in the proper quarter, so that Marres may be sent for and made to refund his extortions and may receive suitable punishment, and that we being undisturbed may be enabled to attend to the collection of the revenues and the interests of the king may suffer no harm. Farewell. Since then Marres the accused besides his extortions oppresses the cultivators, it is impossible to proceed with the collection of the sums owed for rent and crowns, … the pledges which we have from Lysanias the (king's) cousin and strategos), whereby we are hindered in the collection, the cultivators having had their suspicions aroused and retired to the neighboring villages … 51st (??) year, Pachon 10.
