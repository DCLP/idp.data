cu500_t | 1 | Hermias to his dearest Akousilaos, very many greetings. Give heed to Soterichos the stonemason on account of the encroachments being made on him by a neighbor who has bought some of the adjoining property, and (inform?) Lusimachos the komogrammateus. Remember how zealous you were at Tristomos to remain with me. I beg you to close the matter with all speed, in order that when Soterichos comes to me on the 24th he may answer to me for your activity. Good-bye. The 3rd year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, the 17th of the month Neos Sebastos. (Addressed on the verso) To Akousilaos, toparches of Tebtunis.
