cu500_t | 1 | Adamas to Dionysios, greeting. Ptolemaios has shown me no moderation about the collection, having sworn to Psenemmous and Dionusos and Aristandros, who have engaged to provide 100 transport animals … If the gods are still propitious to them, let them provide them and carry away the grain in the store, for they will hardly appease the fellow. But if they suppose that Petosiris and his brother, who are under the protection of Hippalos, will provide animals, they think foolishly. Let them know too that Ptolemaios son of Hermokrates is waiting until, having paid their price, he has the animals. Goodbye. The 8th year, Epeiph [.]. I have sent a written order to give to N.N. 20 artabas of wheat and 1 artaba of wheat to his servants, total 21.
