cu500_t | 1 | (2nd h.) Received in the 3rd year, Pachon [..]. (1st h.) Polemon to Menches his brother, greeting. I received what you wrote to me, and as for the cultivators whom you said you were sending, I do not require them. Asklepiades has pressed on matters and has imposed in addition to the proper amount 1000 artabas of wheat more, besides money, so I am anxious to make haste. Regarding the komogrammateis whom you mention, they will hardly depart until the 25th. You will be right in not diminishing the report compared with the first one, in order that we may make a good show, and for the rest please hurry on the collection of taxes. Take care of yourself so as to remain in good health. Good-bye. The 3rd year, Pachon 19. (Addressed on the verso) To Menches.
