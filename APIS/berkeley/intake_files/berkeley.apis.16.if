cu500_t | 1 | To Menches, komogrammateus of Kerkeosiris, from Teos son of N.N., crown tenant and inhabitant of the same village. On 8 Mesore of the 4th year while I was engaged with the other elders of the farmers in the collection of the sums owing for the land rent of the same year, Pyrrhichos son of Dionysios, a catoecic cavalryman, and Herakleios son of Poseidippos, an inhabitant of the same village, with very many other persons armed with swords, suddenly came upon my house, and, having thrown off all restraint, they shattered the doors. Having made an entry, they carried off a door and …, although there was no dispute whatever between me and them. For this reason we were impeded in our duties of collection. I therefore present to you this complaint in order that you may subscribe to my statements, having added below a copy of the petition for the competent authorities, so that I may recover my own property and the accused may receive the punishment they deserve. Farewell.
