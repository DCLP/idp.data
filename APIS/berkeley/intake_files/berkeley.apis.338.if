cu500_t | 1 | To Menches, komogrammateus of Kerkeosiris, from Harmiysis son of Sarapion, cultivator of Crown land and inhabitant of the same village. On the 8th of Mesore of the 4th year my house was invaded by Pyrrhichos son of Dionysios, one of the katoikoi hippeis, and Herakleios son of Poseidippos, inhabitant of the said village, with many others armed with swords. They effected a forcible entrance and after bursting open the lock of my mother's apartment carried off the articles mentioned below, though there was no dispute whatever between me and them. I therefore present this complaint to you in order that you may subscribe to my statements and further forward a copy of this petition to the proper officials, so that I may recover my property and the accused may receive the punishment which they deserve. Farewell. A woman's robe worth 1 talent 4000 drachmas; A woman's sleeved tunic worth 4000 drachmas; A jar containing 1600 drachmas of copper.
