cu500_t | 1 | To Ptolemaios, the (king's) cousin and strategos, from Marres son of Marseisouchos, priest of the great god Soknebtynis and also a cultivator of Crown land, living at Tebtunis in the division of Polemon. I have been excessively unfairly treated by Harmiysis, the writer of contracts of the said village. The accused conspired together with Thracidas son of Apollonios, an inhabitant of the said village; in Thoth of the present year I made a lease of the six arouras of Crown land belonging to me near the said village at a fixed rent for the whole of 36 artabas of wheat; but Harmiysis instead of that sum made a lease for 30 artabas of wheat, on the ground that from the whole amount I had received 6 artabas as a pledge, such not being the case … (Here the papyrus breaks off.)
