cu500_t | 1 | To Juvenius Genialis, his highness the prefect of Egypt, from Aurelia Sarapias, of Antinoe. On behalf of my orphan daughter who is under age, my lord prefect, I make this supplication and take refuge in your power. My husband Aurelius Paulus, of Antinoe, departed this life intestate, leaving our daughter, called Paulina, quite young. With regard therefore to the guardianship and administration of the child's property, having found that my own brother, Aurelius Sarapion also called Alexandros, who is also an Antinoite, will owing to his kindness, fidelity, and ties of kinship honorably protect the child, I apply to you with the request on my own responsibility that he may be instituted her guardian, in order that, if it please your most gracious Fortune, you may instruct through an endorsement of my petition the strategos of the Arsinoite nome, where we own land, to make the appointment of the aforesaid Sarapion, that so we may obtain relief. Farewell.
