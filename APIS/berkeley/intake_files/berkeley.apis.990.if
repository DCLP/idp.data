cu500_t | 1 | Apollonios and his fellow-soldiers to his brother Dionusios, greeting. We had paid … to your (?) wife [when she was] here 3000 drachmas of bronze. You will do well to pay these in turn to Horos son of Sisouchos and Ptolemaios son of N.N., who are at Mendes, in our name, and do not detain them. If you do otherwise, you will annoy us all. Goodbye.
