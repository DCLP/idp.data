cu500_t | 1 | N.N. to his dearest N.N., greeting. I have sent you other letters about the 6 robes of Pyrrhos and the 2 cloaks of N.N. telling you to send them to me at any cost, and I am now writing in haste to prevent your being anxious, for I will see that you are not worried. You must know that an inspector of finance in the temples has arrived and intends to go to your division also. Do not be disturbed on this account, as I will get you off. So if you have time write up your books and come to me; for he is a very stern fellow. If anything detains you, send them on to me and I will see you through, as he has become my friend. If you are in any difficulty about expense and at present have no funds to write to me, and I will get you off now as I did at first. I am making haste to write to you in order that you may not put in an appearance yourself; for I will make him let you through before he comes to you. He has instructions to send recalcitrants under guard to the high-priest. But do not neglect yourself nor what I wrote to you to buy for me; and if you also have any …, bring me what you have, as I am in need of them. Good-bye, most honored friend.
