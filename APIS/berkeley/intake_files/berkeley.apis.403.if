cu500_t | 1 | Menches, village scribe of Kerkeosiris in the division of Polemon, to Horos, greeting. You wrote to me that I was to give notice to Heras son of Petalos, an inhabitant of the village, who is arraigned for murder and other offences to appear in three days' time for the decision to be made concerning these charges, and that until the matter was concluded I was to make a list of his property and arrange for it to be placed in bond, and was to send a report stating the measurement, adjoining areas and values of it in detail. Accordingly I gave notice in person to the said Heras on the 14th of the current month at Ptolemais Euergetis that he was to appear for the decision upon the aforesaid charges, and I report that he owns the sixth part of the shrine of the Dioskouroi in the village, on the north and east a canal, of which the total value is one talent of copper. Good-bye. The 4th year, Phaophi 14.
