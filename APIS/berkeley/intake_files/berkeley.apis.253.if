cu500_t | 1 | (Col. II, lines 1-15) (Chorus) Wisest of wise is he, whoever he be of the men of old, who meetly calls thee by the name of the infernal darkness of the Hades-cap. (Hermes) Nay, rather the mighty courier of Zeus, his love's messenger. (Chorus) Having regard to your bombast one may guess that you are indeed Hermes, who has brought me footing it back here. (Hermes) Methinks that in the twinkling of an eye you will set out on another useless task. (Chorus) For keeping on the track of a quarry in sight it is madness to listen to these words. For thou, O Zeus, art indeed a perverter of true speech, because of this heaven-inflicted trouble. (Col. III, lines 2-8) (Hermes?) Zeus devises all means [to accomplish his will]. (Chorus) Is it then perchance again from Zeus? So this is the servant of Zeus! He is coming against me. Hold me, he is coming. He will carry off my hand. My teeth chatter with a great fear.
