cu500_t | 1 | To the chrematistai whose clerk is Do[…] from Polemon also called Petesouchos, village scribe of Kerkeosiris in the division of Polemon. Akousilaos and Ptolemaios, both sons of Herakleides and inhabitants of the said village, have presented to me from you a copy of a petition alleging that I had defrauded them of some land, about which I too have presented to you a memorandum rebutting their charge. Since the proper time for the vintage(?) has arrived and excessive care is necessary to produce sufficient revenue, and I have impending the payment of the taxes and items of the grain-dues for which my office is responsible, I ask you, as the occasion itself requires, to give orders that my case shall be postponed until I am free from the labors above mentioned, in order that I may not be hindered in my duties.
