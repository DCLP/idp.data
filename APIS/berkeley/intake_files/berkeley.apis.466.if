cu500_t | 1 | Philoxenos to Apollos his brother, greeting and good health. As soon as you receive this letter go with Horos son of Kotys to see Hermias the village scribe about the person he has arrested, and to Chairemon the collector; and let him be released and not be troubled by anybody, for Demetrios has written to me about him, saying that he is under his protection, and his tenant. I am therefore writing to you to give them instructions.
