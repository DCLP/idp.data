cu500_t | 1 | To Aurelius Julius Marcellinus, centurion, from Aurelia Tisais, whose mother is Tais, formerly styled as an inhabitant of the village of Tebtunis in the division of Polemon. My father Kalabalis, Sir, who is a hunter, set off with my brother Neilos as long ago as the 3rd of the present month to hunt hares, and up to this time they have not returned. I therefore suspect that they have met with some accident, and I present this statement making this matter known to you, in order that if they have met with any accident the persons found guilty may be held accountable to me. (2nd h.) I happen to have also presented a copy of this notice to the strategos Aurelius Idiomachos to be placed on the register. (1st h.) The 25th year of Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Caesar the Lord, Choiak 26.
