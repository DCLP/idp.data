cu500_t | 1 | (Greek) The 18th year of Caesar, Payni 12, Registered by Herodes, writer of contracts at ... (2nd h.) I, Pakemis son of Pakemis, an inhabitant of Hiera in the division of Polemon, Persian of the Epigone, have received from Tameischis daughter of Sokonopis, my wife, the loan of her dowry with clothing, making 24 drachmas of silver, which I will repay. If a separation between us take place, I will pay it within 30 days from the day on which I receive notice, without any delay or subterfuge, as aforesaid; and I have placed the contract, being valid, in the hands of Ptolemaios. I, Hippias, wrote for him at his request because he stated that he was illiterate.
