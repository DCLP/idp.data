cu500_t | 1 | To his highness the epistrategos Vettius Tu…, from Kronous daughter of Zoilos son of Petesouchos, of the village of Tebtunis in the division of Polemon of the Arsinoite nome. A long while ago, my lord, my aforesaid father was selected as a superintendent of confiscated property, and after the appointed term of his office he died without means, leaving nothing at all; yet ever since the thirteenth year of the deified Aurelius Antoninus demands have wrongfully been made upon me for the government dues payable on behalf of the property. Wherefore, my lord, since it has been ordered that women should be exempt from such burdens, I, being a defenseless woman weighted with many years and in danger of having to leave my home on this account, perforce take refuge with you, begging you now to give orders that the property standing in the name of my father be transferred to … and to living persons (?) … Farewell. (2nd hand) Year .., Mesore 10. If there is no hindrance (?) apply to the strategos. To be delivered.
