cu500_t | 1 | To Arkas, one of the first friends and chief chamberlains, who is performing the duties of strategos, from Petosiris son of Spagis and his fellow superintendents of the precinct of Arsinoe at Oxyrhyncha in the division of Polemon. Some of the tax payers from the village, and others, forcing their way into the aforesaid precinct not only to impose insolence and injury … We therefore having sailed down to Alexandria presented a petition to the king and queen in which we set forth a statement similar to the above; this was sent on to [-]llides, who was strategos, having the command attached … that neither the precinct nor the superintendents should be injured but should be left undisturbed in accordance with their request. The [superintendents] also … wrote accordingly to the epistates of the village, and likewise presented many memoranda to you on the same subject, in response to which you wrote to Ptolemaios, the epistates of the village, to allow no one to do anything improper and to produce the persons named. Up to the present, however, no notice has been taken. We beg that henceforth the command of the king and queen should be applied to the precinct and that a copy of this should be engraved upon the outer gate of the precinct below the existing tablet in order that no one may force their way in by it, and request you, if you think fit, to allow us to carry out the command ... (Here the papyrus breaks off.)
