cu500_t | 1 | To Chairemon, one of the diadochoi and epimeletes, from Heliodoros son of Apollonios, of Krokodilon polis. I am the cultivator of 55 1/2 1/4 arouras of Crown land at Boubastos, of which the rent falling due from me at the rate of 4 1/2 1/12 is 254 1/2 1/3 1/12 artabas, and I have busied myself night and day with the irrigation of these owing to the breach of the dyke at Boubastos, in order not to miss the right season. But a certain Zenon, who temporarily is living, like myself, at Krokodilon polis, mischievously presented a petition against me to the local judges of Crown and private cases … Farewell. (2nd hand) To Heriemounis. Inquire into the matter to see if it is true. To Thoonis: Bring them before Sokmenis. ... (Addressed on the verso) To Thoonis, epistates.
