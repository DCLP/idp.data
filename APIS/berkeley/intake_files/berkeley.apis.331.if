At the metropolis I gave you 12 drachmas and asked you to give them to Lysimachos and ask him on my behalf to send me at once 3 he-asses without blemish, for I knew that both Lysimachos and you had plenty of them. I asked you, dear friend, since I knew that it was convenient for you, and that I shall have fine animal without blemish and good-tempered with your help. Good-bye. The 34th year of Caesar, Payni 21. (Addressed on the verso) To Akous, dioiketes, at the city.
