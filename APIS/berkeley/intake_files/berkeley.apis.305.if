cu500_t | 1 | Chaireas to his most honored Ma…, very many greetings. I believe that you are aware how much trouble I had in getting the circumcision through, owing to the high-priest's desire to see the boy, but by means of the good offices of our friends we achieved it. Good-bye, my brother. Salute Kronion and all his household. You will oblige me by sending the cloths, as I am in a hurry, and get me three matia of dried coriander and a measure of cumin, and send them to me, as I want to manufacture oil.
