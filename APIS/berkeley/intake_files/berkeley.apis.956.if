cu500_t | 1 | Appolonios, chief of the phulakitai at Ibion Eikosipentarouron, to Mestasutmis, greeting. Diotimos son of N.N., and Petosiris the elder, son of Psenesis, and Petosiris the younger, and Petosiris son of Horos, of the guards from Tebtunis, having been selected by Ptolemaios, the archiphulakites of the division, and having taken in writing the oath by the king that they would devote themselves to the guarding of the crops of the aforesaid Ibion and of Xulitis for the 29th year, Petosiris the younger, son of Psenesis, did not present himself to guard. Since, therefore, we have forebodings that the rest may also perhaps abandon the guarding if no notice is taken, we thought it necessary to write, in order that, if you think fit, you may report him to N.N., one of the diadochoi and epimeletes, and he may answer for [his conduct?]. Goodbye. The 29th year (month, day). (Addressed on the verso) To Mestasutmis.
