cu500_t | 1 | To Menches, komogrammateus of Kerkeosiris, from Apollophanes son of Dionysodoros, cultivator of Crown land from the same village. On the 20th of Phaophi in the 5th year Nikon son of Amenneus, an inhabitant of the said village, let out the water on his own land and flooded 2 1/4 arouras of the Crown land belonging to me, which was then being ploughed, with the result that they were completely (ruined) and I suffered damage amounting to 20 artabas of wheat. I therefore present to you this complaint in order that the accused may be summoned and compelled to refund me the damage; and if he refuses I beg you to forward a copy of the petition to the proper officials, so that I may have it placed on record and the king may incur no loss. Farewell.
