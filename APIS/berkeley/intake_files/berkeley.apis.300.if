cu500_t | 1 | To Aurelius Sarapammon, who is past his prime, and Aurelia Heraklia acting without a guardian, both children of Heron, from …is, Sarapammon having as curatrix his sister the aforesaid Heraklia, from Aurelius Demetrios, however he is styled. I wish to lease from you the half share owned by you at the village of Theogonis of nine grain-bearing arouras in one parcel, which formerly were leased to Heron, for a period of four years dating from the sowing of the present 13th year at the annual rent for the half share of the 9 arouras, with no advance of seed-grain, of 12 artabas of wheat. And I have received forthwith from you, for the restoration of the operations upon the land which has been delivered by Heron in a dry condition, the 300 drachmas of silver which you have received from him for the restoration of the land, in order that I may deliver it in clean condition; and it shall not be lawful for me to renounce the lease before the end of the period on any account, but I will of necessity perform all the annual operations, the making of dykes, irrigating, ploughing, hoeing, banking up of canals and conduits, building of insets, weeding, gathering stalks, and all else that is fitting, at my own expense in the proper seasons, without causing any injury, all the state dues being paid by you the landlords. The annual rent I will pay in the month Payni at the threshing-floor measured by the 4-choinix dromos measure; and at the end of the period I will deliver up the land free from rushes, reeds, coarse grass, and dirt of all kinds. If I fail to deliver it, I will pay the 300 drachmas which I have received, you having no power to transfer the lease or to work the land yourselves during the aforesaid period; and in answer to the formal question I have given my consent. I, Aurelius Demetrios have leased the arouras on the condition that I will return them restored because I have received the three hundred drachmas for them, and in answer to the formal question I have given my consent. I, Aurelius Arsinoos, have written for him because he is illiterate. The 13th year of our Lord Gallienus Augustus, Phaophi 21.
