cu500_t | 1 | To Petosiris, komogrammateus of Oxyrhyncha, from Asklepiades, sitologos for cavalry dues in the division of Polemon. On the .. of the present month, when I was bathing in the bath here, being seriously ill, after I had come out of the bath in an exhausted condition, Pasis son of Aretion and (blank) and (blank), attendants at the said bath, because he had 15 drachmas of silver seized my servant, who wished to [keep me away] from those who were pressing on me, and when I looked at them …, with no regard for decency having beaten me and kicked me in the stomach they fancied they would escape; but the servant with me having shouted for help in the king's name, several persons arrived, but Petesouchos son of Harpokratios, one of the bath-men, came up and by the use of force rescued the aforesaid culprits. As, therefore, my life is in danger owing to the blows I received, I beg you, if you think fit, to secure the culprits until we come to the general session. I have presented a copy also to the usual officials. Farewell.
