                  <summary>This papyrus contains two documents which are written in different hands and have no certain connection to each other. The first is apparently an extract from an official taxing list containing amounts of land belonging to Apolinaria, partly her individual property, partly held jointly by her and others. The second document is an abstract or copy, probably made in the record-office, of a letter from Aurelius Sarapas calling attention to the fact that a piece of land (?) which he had recently bought and registered in the usual manner was still reckoned in the official taxing list belonging to its previous owner, a woman whose name is not given, but whose name may have been Apolinaria mantioned in the first document. The copy of Sarapas' document stops at the point when it was about to give a edtailed description of the property in question, and does not seem to have been finished.</summary>
