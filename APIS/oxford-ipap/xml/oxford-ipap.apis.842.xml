                  <summary>On the recto a letter stating that the writer had received a letter from Zenon bidding him keep faith with certain shepherds, who were dissatisfied with the land assigned to them for pasturage.  In answer he protests that he has not only given them the place which they had leased, but another piece as well, for which he might have got a price from other people. But they insisted on him giving them some land which he had already disposed of by contract and which was scattered through various basins. This he refused to cede, but in accordance with Zenon's request he gave them 200 arourai of dry land in one basin. In the postscript he asks for some goads for guarding the wild oxen. On the verso a duplicate receipt in which Zenon acknowledges that he has received from Pyrrhos the rent for the pigs which the latter in partnership with Pytheas had hired from Epharmostos (Zenon's brother) according to a contract deposited with Archagathos, amounting to 50 drachmae, and also the pigs themselves numbering 12 1/2 (or Pyrrhos' share of 25).</summary>
