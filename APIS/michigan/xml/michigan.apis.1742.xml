            <ab>Sarapion to his most esteemed Antonius Minor, greeting. As I was sailing down to Alexandria in haste, it happened that I went to the lodging, which is in Memphis, of the employees of your estate, so that I might write to you from there, and I found no one who was going to you. When I sailed upriver with the prefect and fell in with our friend Marcus, I sought to discover if you were there. And since I did not find you, I made assiduous inquiries about your health, and I went upcountry delighted to learn that you were well. I write to you now, therefore, most esteemed friend, first to salute you and my lord Ammonianus and all your kin, and then to ask you by all means to lend me through Morion&amp;apos;s men three full-grown cows, fine and large in body, since I am about to plow land that has lain fallow. It is for this that I have need of them. In order that you may accomplish this for me with dispatch, I beg you to let me know their price, and I will send it to you from here. For to Morion&amp;apos;s man, who is in a hurry to get away, I have not been able to give the price, since it is uncertain.  . . . was bought. (2nd hand) I pray for your good health, my lord, together with that of my lord Ammonianos and all your kin. Send me the cows by all means since I have need of them for the farms. And if you have a reason for going to Alexandria, come to me there by all means, for I am just now about to go there, with the gods&amp;apos; help.;(3rd hand: one unintelligible line).;;(Verso) To Antonius Minor, former royal secretary of the Diopolite(?) nome.</ab>
