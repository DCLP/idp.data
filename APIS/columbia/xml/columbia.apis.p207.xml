            <ab>	[To ... ], the most distinguished praeses [of Augustamnica?], greeting [from] Aurelius Valerius son of Antiourios from the village of Karanis [of the] Arsinoite Nome. I pay taxes, I and my brothers, [for] eighty arouras, of which one-half are sown, and the other half are unfarmed. Since ... when the land was measured, the horiodiktes of the district, Palemon, because of malice recorded all the arouras as arable and which are mediocre, . . . , since there is a conduit through which our plots are watered, the same horiodiktes Palemon reported them in the category of arable land, although everybody draws water from it [the conduit], not [all the adjacent land] is seeded. I ask your magnificence, since also when Porphyrios the surveyor measured he did justice and reported the arable land as arable, but the waste, sandy land as waste land, but Palemon the horiodiktes reported all the arouras as arable, and since Tapaeis daughter of Heras, my kinsman, has taken to flight, being the possessor of twenty-three of the finest possible arouras they reported her as having ... so that if it please you to order ... that horiodiktes. 
</ab>
