            <ab>To the superintendents of sequestered property of Bacchias. Having secured . . . the profit to the fiscus, the responsibility and risk to be yours if you either receive the bid of another, without giving notice to me, or act improperly. In the fifth year of Antoninus Caesar the lord, Pachon 28. (2 H.) I, Sarapion, have signed.
To Sarapion, royal scribe of the Herakleides division of the Arsinoite Nome, from Chairemon son of Chairemon, grandson of Apollonios, from the Syrian ward. I wish to introduce a supplementary bid to the one by which I undertook to lease, in the present year in the month of Pharmouthi, the house and yard in Bacchias from the confiscated property formerly belonging to Apynchis son of Peteuris, for five years for an annual rent in total instead of the eight drachmas promised before by me per year, each year twenty drachmas, which I will pay on the customary appointed days, and after the period of five years I will return it as I received it, if you agree to give the lease.
