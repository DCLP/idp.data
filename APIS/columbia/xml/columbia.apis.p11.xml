            <ab>	Zenon, Protogenes and Apollonides to Zenon, greeting. Hearing of the good will which you entertain towards all your fellow-citizens, we commend you; and we would gladly have met you beforehand, desiring to chat with you concerning matters of advantage to the city and about ourselves. Since it has not come about that you were able to (receive ?) the three of us, be- lieving that it behooves you as it does the rest of our townsmen whose public life is upon a high plane to give thought to these things, we beg you, along with Pyrrhias and Apollonides, to present to Apollonios the letter which we have given to Apollonides, [a letter] which is useful to us all. And if you are able in any other way to work with us to the end that we may obtain con- sideration, [we request you to do so] with the full knowledge that when we return to our own city we shall not be unmindful of these things, but will in turn disclose them to the assembly so that it is clear to you [that we are not unniindfull. And we will personally, also, try to return the favor.
			Good-by.
