            <ab>Longus to Julius his father, greetings. Please do not neglect to write me, through anyone you may find, what you decide about the thirty items.  Since, from when I sailed downriver, this is the fifth letter my father will be writing me about them, and he is growing angry, and I am going to buy them, will you make up your mind? Tell me through anyone you can--only don't let anyone find out what you're doing--if the registry is issuing the deed and the items are clear of mortgage and of idios logos. And write me quickly. I beseech you, concerning my affairs don't neglect what I have instructed you. Also the animals: don't let them be idle, so that . . . let them be stabled lest they be worn out . . .  Greet Diogenes and . . . and mother Kyris and your wife. And please be sure to write me about the thirty items . . . Keep well for a long time. Pauni . . . (Addressed) To Julius Heironinus, to Philadelphia, [from] Longus . . .
</ab>
