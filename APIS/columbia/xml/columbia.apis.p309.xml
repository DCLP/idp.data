            <ab>To Aurelius Har[pokration, strategos of the] Oxyrhynchite (nome).
From Aurelius  [   ]ion the secretary of Claudia Isidora alias Apia, and however she may be called. Aurelia Sarapous daughter of Didymos, granddaughter of Petosorapis . . . having given (money?) for the purchase of plants which are in the kleros called Tmo near Nemera, belonging to the lady, past the sycamore trees near the water wheel, and having taken Eirenaios to herself as a partner, . . . not only did they cut down the plants which had been assigned (to Sarapous), but also the very sycamore trees near the water wheel, mature trees, nine in number. So that the quality of the improperly cut down sycamore trees be made clear, so that the right against them with respect to . . . (?) remain with the lady, out of necessity, I am making submission of this petition asking that you send . . . .
