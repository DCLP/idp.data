            <ab>Praying above all for your health, [e.g., I hope that you are flourishing] and faring well. When our brother Th[..]ros was so kind as to come here, he led astray the girl named Theodora, and she took from me fourteen keratia lita. Likewise I went surety for her to the cellarkeeper for eight keratia lita. She took also a stichomaphorion and an othonion, and I am having these demanded from me as her surety. I wrote these things to you, true companion and overseer, for Sokoris the "Fourth" and Alypios the "Second". Take care how much you exert yourself. For I know that you are careful.</ab>
