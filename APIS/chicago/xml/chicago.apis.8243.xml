                  <summary>As originally presented, the manuscript contained a blank flyleaf of "Alf Lailah" and the first folio, consisting of the title page and the first page of text.  The chonological order of the six entries seems to be: The Alf Lailah or "Thousand Nights" fragment, Scattered phrases on pages 2 and 3, Outline drawing of the figure of a man on page 2, A second group of scattered phrases in different hands on page 2, Rough draft of a letter on page 1, Formulas of legal testimony dated Safar 266 A.H. / October 879 A.D. written on the margins of all 4 pages.</summary>

                     <p>Two lines written on page 3, below the initial entry for the title page are in a fine and careful book hand, but one different from the text of "Thousand Nights" and different from and in a different ink than the three lines on page 2, upper section.  Except for the earlier text of the "Nights," both entries have priority to space on their respective pages.  The succeeding entries are fitted into the remaining space.</p>
